         We expect you to spend no more than two hours working on the following problem.<br /> 
         You may use any source as reference material but the solution provided must be your own work.<br /> You may use utility methods from a JavaScript library e.g. using JQuery to make Ajax calls is OK.</p><b>Task 1:</b><br />
         Create a web page which displays a list of user names.<br />
         The list is read from a JSON file.<br /> Youâ€™ll have to design the JSON format yourself.<br /><br />
         <b>Task 2:</b><br />
         Create a reusable JavaScript control which will display a business card for a user in the list
         <ul>
            <li>The business card will show at least the users name, job title, email address, company name and phone number</li>
            <li>The business card will pop-up</li>
            <li>Add one extra feature based on what you think is important</li>
         </ul>
