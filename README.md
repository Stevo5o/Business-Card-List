JS JSON AJAX jQuery sweetalert.js
A small JS challange using of course JavaScript, jQuery, AJAX, reading and displaying JSON file data - list of user names with details.
When user name is selected a pop-up displays that users details stored in the JSON file.
For the pop-up I used a little JS lib called sweetalert.js
